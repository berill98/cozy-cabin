## Site Owner Goals

- To provide the user with information about the woodland cabin.
- To present the user with a website that is easy to navigate, fully responsive and evokes a sense of calm through the use of appropriate colors and imagery.
- To enable the user to book a weekend or more in the cabin.
- To increase the number of the customers.

## User stories

- As an user I want to understand the main purpose of the site and learn about the woodland cabin. 
- As an user I want to be able to easily navigate the website and have a positive emotional experience. 
- As an user I want to be able to browse the gallery without having to sign-up / register. 
- As an user I want to be able to easily book a weekend or more in the cabin. 
- As an user I want to be able to contact and follow the cabin via social media.

## UX

### Fonts

- I have used Google Fonts to find the fonts that best suit the feel of the website. I have used [Yeseva One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yeseva+One) and [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) for the website. I used Cursive and Sans Serif as backup fonts, in case for any reason the main fonts aren't able to load correctly.

### Icons

- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Colors and images

- The colours on the website are natural colors. The main colours are white, green, brown and grey. The dark fonts have a good contrast with the light green and white backgrounds making it easy to read.
- The images used on the website are very important. I used photos just from one photographer to achieve a matching effect.
