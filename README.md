## Site Owner Goals

## Design choices

### Fonts

- I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find the fonts that best suit the feel of the website. I have used Yeseva One and Work Sans for the website. I used Cursive and Sans Serif as backup fonts, in case for any reason the main fonts aren't able to load correctly.

### Icons

- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Colors and images

- The colours on the website are natural colors. The main colours are white, green, brown and grey. The dark fonts have a good contrast with the light green and white backgrounds making it easy to read.
- The images used on the website are very important. I used photos just from one photographer to achieve a matching effect.
